operators to test "what-if" scenarios before implementing changes in the 
real world, reducing risk and optimizing operations.

PRIMARY VALUE PROPOSITION:
- Test changes virtually before deploying physically
- Predict impact of emergencies, weather, and demand spikes
- Optimize network capacity without trial-and-error
- Reduce driver wait times and lost swaps

4. KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)
================================================================================

4.1 DRIVER-CENTRIC KPIs
-----------------------

a) Average Wait Time (minutes)
   - Definition: Time from arrival to swap completion
   - Target: < 5 minutes
   - Impact: Higher wait = driver churn, bad reviews

b) Lost Swaps (count)
   - Definition: Drivers who left without swapping (queue too long)
   - Target: < 2% of total demand
   - Impact: Lost revenue, frustrated customers

c) Rerouted Drivers (count)
   - Definition: Drivers sent to alternate stations
   - Context: Happens during emergencies or overloads
   - Impact: Slightly longer trips but service maintained


4.2 OPERATIONAL KPIs
--------------------

a) Charger Utilization (%)
   - Definition: Percentage of chargers actively swapping
   - Target: 70-85% (sweet spot)
   - Too Low: Wasted CAPEX on idle chargers
   - Too High: No buffer for demand spikes

b) City Throughput (swaps/hour)
   - Definition: Total network capacity being utilized
   - Target: Maximize while keeping wait times acceptable
   - Impact: Direct correlation to revenue

c) Idle Inventory (%)
   - Definition: Batteries sitting unused
   - Target: < 15%
   - Impact: Working capital tied up in idle batteries


4.3 FINANCIAL KPIs
------------------

a) Operational Cost (₹/day)
   - Includes: Electricity, staffing, maintenance
   - Target: Minimize while maintaining service levels
   - Calculated per station and network-wide

b) Revenue Impact
   - Lost swaps × average swap price = lost revenue
   - Throughput increases = revenue gains
